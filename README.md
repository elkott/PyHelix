# PyHelix
A Python program to generate and store data from a helix equation.

# How to use PyHelix

## Prerequisites
In order to run PyHelix, please place both __helixLib.py__, and __helixGeometry.py__ in the same directory on your local machine.
PyHelix has the following dependencies:
- numpy Used to perform numerical operations
- matplotlib.pyplot Used to plot the resulting helix
- mpl_toolkits.mplot3d \t Used to render 3D axes on Matplotlib
- csv Used to store helix points, and normal vectors in a CSV file
If you do not wish to plot the resulting helix, you may omit the code to import, and call _matplotlib.pyplot_, and _mpl_toolkits.mplot3d_ from __helixLib.py__*

## Usage
* Download __helixLib.py__, and __helixGeometry.py__, and place them in the same directory. __helixGeometry.py__ is the main file, and it references the functions defined in __helixLib.py__.
